### **1. Data size**
the data from  [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
Download from this [site](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip), which had the image to 32Ã—32.
`data info:`
* Number of training examples = 34799
* Number of validation examples = 4410
* Number of testing examples = 12630
* Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
* Number of classes = 43
`some data and labels:`

### **2. Preprocess**
only shuttle the data just like: *X_train, y_train = shuffle(X_train, y_train)*

### **3. Model Architecture**
the original network from [LeNet-Lab](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LeNet-Lab)
Implement the [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) neural network architecture.
 ### 3.1. Input
The LeNet architecture accepts a 32x32xC image as input, where C is the number of color channels. if are grayscale, C is 1 in this case. The channles in those image is 3(RGB)

#### 3.2. original LeNet Architecture
**Layer 1: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 28x28x6.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
**Pooling.** The output shape should be 14x14x6.

**Layer 2: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 10x10x16.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
**Pooling.** The output shape should be 5x5x16.

**Flatten.** Flatten the output shape of the final pooling layer such that it's 1D instead of 3D. The easiest way to do is by using `tf.contrib.layers.flatten`, which is already imported for you.

**Layer 3: Fully Connected.** This should have 120 outputs.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.

**Layer 4: Fully Connected.** This should have 84 outputs.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.

**Layer 5: Fully Connected (Logits).** This should have 10 outputs.

#### 3.3  Used network:
**Layer 1: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 30x30x6.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.

**Layer 2: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 28x28x6.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
**Pooling.** The output shape should be 10x10x6.

**Layer 3: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 10x10x16.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
**Pooling.** The output shape should be 5x5x16.

**Flatten.** 

**Layer 4: Fully Connected.** This should have 120 outputs.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
**dropout.**
**Layer 5: Fully Connected.** This should have 84 outputs.
**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.

**Layer 6: Fully Connected (Logits).** This should have 43 outputs.
Final model just like this:

| Convolution 5x5x16    | outputs 10x10x16.      			|
| RELU			| tf.nn.relu					|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16  		    	|
| Flatten		| 1600.        					|
| RELU			| tf.nn.relu					|
| Flatten		| 120.        					|
| RELU			| tf.nn.relu					|
| Flatten		| 84.        					|
| RELU			| tf.nn.relu					|
| Dropout		| 0.7						|
| Flatten		| 43.        					|

#### 3.3  Output
Return the result of the 2nd fully connected layer.
